# Forming a request

How you send requests to the Streaming Writer API will vary depending on
the client or language you’re using. But the API still has behaviour and
expectations that is common across all clients.

!!! tip

	The examples in this section show how to use the popular [`curl`](https://curl.se/){target=_blank} command line tool.

## Before you begin

  - Sign up on the Quix Portal

  - Read about [Authenticating with the Streaming Writer
    API](authenticate.md)

## Endpoint URLs

The Streaming Writer API is available on a per-workspace basis, so the
subdomain is based on a combination of your organisation and workspace
names. See the [Swagger
documentation](get-swagger.md) to find out how
to get the exact hostname required. It will be in this format:

https://writer-${organisation}-${workspace}.platform.quix.ai

So your final endpoint URL will look something like:

https://writer-acme-weather.platform.quix.ai/

## Method

Endpoints in this API use the `POST` and `PUT` methods. Ensure your HTTP
client sends the correct request method.

Using `curl`, you can specify the request method with the `-X
<POST|PUT>` flag, for example:

``` bash
curl -X PUT ...
```

## Payload

For most methods, you’ll need to send a JSON object containing supported
parameters. You’ll also need to set the appropriate content type for the
payload you’re sending:

``` bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" ...
```

!!! warning

	You **must** specify the content type of your payload. Failing to
	include this header will result in a `415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE`
	status code.

You can send data using the `curl` flag `-d`. This should be followed by
either a string of JSON data, or a string starting with the *@* symbol,
followed by a filename containing the JSON data.

``` bash
curl -d '{"key": "value"}' ...
curl -d "@data.json" ...
```

!!! tip

	By default, `-d` will send a `POST` request, so `-X POST` becomes unnecessary.

## Complete curl example

You should structure most of your requests to the API around this
pattern:

``` bash
curl -H "Authorization: ${token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "@data.json" \
     https://${domain}.platform.quix.ai/${endpoint}
```
